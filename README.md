## Introduction

A responsive AngularJS-based common header implementation to be used across Rise Vision web applications and pages.

Rise Vision Common Header works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](https://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](https://apps.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Built With
<!-- example list follows, replace with actual tools used -->

- [NPM (node package manager)](https://www.npmjs.org/)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [AngularJS](https://https://angularjs.org/)

## Usage

```

### html
``` html
<script src="components/common-header/dist/dependencies.js"></script>
<script src="components/common-header/dist/common-header.js"></script>
```

#### gulpfile.js
For the build output, process the html file with gulp-usemin, ensuring the js
target is included and the jsdev target is ignored so that it gets removed from the html file.
...

``` js
.pipe(usemin({
  js: [uglify({mangle:false, outSourceMap: true})]
})
.pipe(gulp.dest("dist/");
```
